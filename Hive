1. Find the count of people visiting.
SELECT count(DISTINCT host) FROM weblogs;

2. Find peak hours of operations.
SELECT SUBSTR(time,14,2), COUNT(request) as CNT FROM weblogs GROUP BY SUBSTR(time,14,2) ORDER BY CNT DESC LIMIT 5;

3. Find the trending links (Top 5).
SELECT request, COUNT(request) AS CNT FROM weblogs GROUP BY request ORDER BY CNT DESC LIMIT 5;

4. Count of people who made paid clicks. Links that have (“gclid”) in the link.
SELECT SUBSTR(time,2,11),COUNT(request) FROM weblogs  WHERE request LIKE '%gclid%' GROUP BY SUBSTR(time,2,11);

5. Count of people who made clicks and never returned.
SELECT count(host) FROM weblogs GROUP BY host HAVING count(host) == 1;

6. Count the number returning customers and non-returning customers.
SELECT count(host) FROM weblogs GROUP BY host HAVING count(host) == 1;
SELECT count(host) FROM weblogs GROUP BY host HAVING count(host) >= 1;

7. Count of frequency of visits per ip.
SELECT host, COUNT(host) FROM weblogs GROUP BY host;
